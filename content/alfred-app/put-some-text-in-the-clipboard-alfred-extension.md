# Put Some Text in the Clipboard - Alfred Extension

Another super simple [Alfred App](http://www.alfredapp.com/) extension.

I sometimes find that I need to pop some text into the clipboard, and wondered if there was a easy way I could achieve this with my favourite productivity tool [Alfred](http://www.spacecadet9.com/category/alfred/)

And I did... and create this very simple extension.

Simple invoke Alfred, type "clip" then the text you want in the clipboard.  Then go to wherever you want to go and paste the text.

I mostly use this when making up my own passwords, and of course on most websites you need to put the password in twice...
