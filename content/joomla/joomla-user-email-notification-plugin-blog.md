# Joomla User Email Notification Plugin

As standard, when you create a new user in [Joomla!](http://www.spacecadet9.com/category/joomla/) that user gets an e-mail to tell them their user details.

This is super useful… Unless you don't want them to get an e-mail..!

Then you've gotta try to find how to stop it…

Tricky!

But I found it…

Go to **Plug-in Manager** on the **Extensions** menu.

Then use the search feature to find the **User - Joomla!** plugin.

In the Basic Options of this plugin you can enable and **disable** "Notification Mail to User".
