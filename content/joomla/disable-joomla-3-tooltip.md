# Disable Joomla! 3 Tool Tip

I tend to find that the default [Joomla!](http://www.joomla.org/) Tool Tips tend to be a little busy and obstrusive. In most of the sites I build I am more and more focusing on a more uncluttered user interface in my design work.

This is just here a litle *aide de memoire* for how to just get rid of them completely.

In your css for the site:

`.tooltip-inner{
    display:none;
}
`

This definately works in Joomla! 3, I'll let you know if I can confirm it for Joomla! 2.5
