# Readable Wearables

> So will people use their watch-like devices for browsing the web? Though some may scoff at the idea (and believe me, there’s been plenty of scoffing), stranger things have happened. And if the last few years have taught us anything, it’s that if you can use something to get on the web, people will get on the web with that thing.

I love the sentiments in this article. I have clients who still scoff at people wanting to see their website on a smartphone. And I have to patiently explain that people will definitely, absolutely see their site on a phone!
